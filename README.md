# Calculator

## About the project

A front-end calculator app imitating a simple desktop calculator using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

It has the basic operations (add, substract, divide and multiply) typical of a calculator, negative and decimal numbers, keyboard support and only evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time. All of this is done without the `eval()` function.

## Project reflections

In this project I learned two main things:

- The importance of tests, specially if there is coupling between functions. Modifying a function can affect others in unexpected ways.
- The importance of designing the solution before getting to write code, using diagrams and pseudocode.

Also, I had to refactor the code several times as new functionality was added, learning how different functions interacted with each other.

As a future addition, it would be nice to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions instead of only two numbers at a time.
