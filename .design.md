# Calculator

## Functionality

Calculator that does basic operations, it adds, substracts, buttonides and multiplies. Input is done by clicking the buttons on the interface and the results are displayed on the display of the interface. Some particularities are:

- Each operation should be evaluated one at a time, only evaluate a single pair of numbers
- Only the current number or last operation should be displayed
- Equal with only one number and one operator, duplicate the number
- Equal with only one number, should do nothing

## UI

- Interactive elements (pressing them executes code)
  - Digits (0 - 9)
  - Operators (+, -, /, x, +-, =)
  - Clear (AC)
- Non interactive
  - Display (all numbers and results are displayed here)
- Design with Figma
  - Background, primary (highlight) and secondary (highlight) colors

## Logic

// TODO: Change equalWasClicked global variable
// TODO: Change getoperands and getpopulationtokens functions

- Add, substract, buttonide, multiply functions
  - Take two arguments (operands) and returns result
  - If only one operand make 2nd default to first
- Function operate selects which math function to do
  - This only executes when there is an operator AND operator is clicked
- Function/s that handles the logic on the basis of which tokens are stored
  - Depending of number of tokens
    - No operands (0 by default)
    - One operand (left operand)
    - One operand and operator
    - Two operands and operator
- Function that populates display on each click
  - Check for NaN values
- Store numbers, operators and result of operations in a variable (function?)
- Round results with long decimals
- Pressing clear wipes out all data

## Pseudocode

```
OBJECT tokens
  leftOperand: 0
  operator: ''
  rightOperand: 0

OBJECT math
  FUNCTION add(x, y)
    RETURN x + y
  FUNCTION substract(x, y)
    RETURN x + y
  FUNCTION buttonide(x, y)
    RETURN x + y
  FUNCTION multiply(x, y)
    RETURN x + y

FUNCTION operate(leftOperand, operator, rightOperand=leftOperand)
  IF +
    RETURN CALL math.add(leftOperand, rightOperand)
  IF -
    RETURN CALL math.substract(leftOperand, rightOperand)
  IF *
    RETURN CALL math.multiply(leftOperand, rightOperand)
  IF /
    RETURN CALL math.buttonide(leftOperand, rightOperand)

FUNCTION populateDisplay(number)
  IF (number === Infinity)
    DISPLAY NaN
  ELSE
    DISPLAY number.substring(0, 7)

FUNCTION erase
  tokens.rightOperand = 0
  tokens.operator = ''
  tokens.leftOperand = 0

FUNCTION insertNumber
  IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador AND tokens.righOperand)
    tokens.righOperand += number
    CALL populateDisplay(tokens.rightOperand)
  ELSE
    tokens.leftOperand += number
    CALL populateDisplay(tokens.leftOperand)

FUNCTION insertMathOperator
  IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador AND tokens.righOperand)
    resultado = CALL operate (tokens.leftOperand, tokens.operador, tokens.righOperand)
    CALL erase
    tokens.leftOperand = resultado
    tokens.operator = operatorNuev
    CALL populateDisplay(resultado)
  ELSE IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador OR tokens.leftOperand)
    tokens.operator = operatorNuev

FUNCTION evaluate
  IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador AND tokens.righOperand)
    resultado = CALL operate (tokens.leftOperand, tokens.operador, tokens.righOperand)
    CALL erase
    tokens.leftOperand = resultado
    CALL populateDisplay(resultado)
  ELSE IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador)
    resultado = CALL operate(tokens.leftOperand, tokens.operador)
    CALL erase
    tokens.leftOperand = resultado
    CALL populateDisplay(resultado)

FUNCTION reset
  CALL erase
  CALL populateDisplay(0)

FUNCTION insertNegative
  IF (tokens.leftOperand AND tokens.operador AND tokens.righOperand)
    tokens.righOperand *= -1
    CALL populateDisplay(tokens.rightOperand)
  ELSE
    tokens.leftOperand *= -1
    CALL populateDisplay(tokens.leftOperand)

WHENEVER number is clicked CALL insertNumber
WHENEVER operator is clicked CALL insertMathOperator
WHENEVER equal is clicked CALL evaluate
WHENEVER clear is clicked CALL reset
WHENEVER sign is clicked CALL insertNegative
```

## Theory

### JavaScript

- An event listener listens out for the event happening (when it fires), and the handler is the code (function) that is run in response to it happening.
- Event listeners attach event handlers to the element.
- Per the DOM 3 documentation, event handlers are executed in order of registration (when the addEventListeners where run).

### CSS

- Pseudo classes are selectors that select regular elements that are in special states. They have the form ':pseudo-class'.
- Pseudo elements effectively create new elements that are not specified in the markup of the document and can be manipulated much like regular elements.
- If a button has only floats, it collapses. To avoid this one can "clear" the float with overflow and clear properties or with pseudo-elements.
  - Overflow sets what to do with content that overflows a container (hide it, clipt it, etc). If it is used with a container with only floats, it fits to them. But, content (like shadows) that goes outside is hidden.
  - Another option is to use clear: both after the last child inside the container.
  - The best option (for screen readers also) is to use the after pseudo-element button.
- It is not advised to abuse the use of ID or overly-specific selectors since they are too tightly coupled to the html they refer to. Because of that they can't be reused. Other problem they bring is that they impact the specificity, which seems is difficult to grasp and can bring its own problems.
  - As a corolary of this, it is advised to structure the code using classes rather than IDs, so it can be reusable.h
- Filter functions are post processing steps after a particular element is drawn. They take a snapshop of the element as a bitmap after is rendered, apply the filter to that bitmap and finally draw that new bitmap over the rendered element. When text is involved, it seems to work differently on firefox than chrome (brightness blurrs text in firefox).

### HTML

- In Google Homepage, they use inputs inside a form (input text inside button and input submit for buttons) and outside they use links inside buttons for buttons.
- An image is a replaced element (embedded content), its content comes from outside the HTML. If you display a r.e. as a block, you will see that it streches but with an added margin. For that, the margin: 0 auto can be used.
